# Day 3 Assignment – GitHub Submission

Welcome! Please follow the instructions carefully to complete your submission.

## ✅ Task:

Submit a Python file that solves the following:

A spy sends you a string of space-separated numbers.
Each number is an ASCII code, but the real message is hidden among them.

- First, pick every 3rd character starting from index 1.
- Then, reverse that sequence.
- Print the final message — no spaces or symbols.

**Input**

```120 101 122 101 100 103 72 111 79 78 99```

**Output**

```code```


Because,

code -> ```99 111 100 101```

reversed -> ```101 100 111 99```

with noise -> 120 **101** 122 101 **100** 103 72 **111** 79 78 **99**
